My GitHub account is pesulz8;

The repository I created is pesulz8.github.io. It is a publically accessible repository. It currently only has a readme file.

GitHub desktop automatically prompted me to create or clone a repository when I first logged in. I clicked "clone a repository". I chose the default location of C:\Users\hdp_s\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\pesulz8.github.io; I then clicked "clone repository". I also pinned the folder in my "quick access" tab, so that I can easily access it in the future.
